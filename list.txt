ideas:


1.  slots (Kaido can take up multiple team slots)

2.  system to compare teams (stats, member size, captains)

3.  average stats of a given team

4.  create heroes and teams through user input

5.  add descriptions (lore) to each hero given by the system, with the ability
    -> to add lore to heroes added through user input

6.  implementation of a nemesis/chemistry/friend system? (batman v joker)

7.  implementation of a save state (text file)

8.  multi user implementation with login system

9.  captain boost? (1.2x/1.5x to a given stat? or add a weakness?)

10. sorts teams into highest to lowest? (stats, members, alphabetical order?)

11. admin login + limit to hero create for admin perms? (hard coded/interface)


12. (possible mechanics)
    Fighting
    Teams can have the bool hero or villain
    Teams can only fight bool if on opposing sides?
    Fighting takes user inputs or simulation occurs


13. admins can
    create and remove heroes--(for balance purposes)
    Delete teams
    See all teams created and by what user
    Change changes made by user, (ex edit a teams name)

14. Users can
    create teams
    add from a pool of characters created by the admin
    name the team
    add a description to their team
    possibly use battle functionality
