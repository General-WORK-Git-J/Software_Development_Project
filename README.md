This is a trial README for you, Lejla, as we want to get your opinion on our project and ideas as is.
Feedback is much appreciated and we await your reply.


## Description/Deliverables:

A multi-user Hero Agency application that allows for the creation of teams of pre-made heroes, with a "team captain" feature.
Each hero has separate stats, and takes up a unique number of "team slots". 
This application will aim to have an admin feature, which will allow for the addition of heroes, teams, captains, and descriptions to the heroes.
It will implement a login system, for the user and a premade admin login as stated above.

We can add:

Battle/fight simulation

Nemesis system

Team sorting and comparison

Save states

A "captain boost" to stats


These are ideas we have at the moment, can be expanded/scaled back as needed.
Thank you for your time. :]
